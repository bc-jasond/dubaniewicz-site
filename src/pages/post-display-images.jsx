    <H1>Images - What's the Web without 'em?</H1>
    <SpacerSection />
    <H2>How does Medium do it?</H2>
    <ContentSection>
      <P>Now that we've got a <LinkStyled to="/posts/nginx">proper webserver in place</LinkStyled> it's time to display some images.  Of the 'insertable' types of sections from Medium's ‚®Å menu, I've only implemented the 'Add a new part'.  That was pretty straightforward lol.</P>
      <P>The most complex thing to implement from that menu is the <SiteInfo>Embed</SiteInfo> type, by far.  There's a lot going on in the background to go from a url to a small, seamless content rich 'widget'.  Embeds will definitely merit several blog posts on their own.</P>
      <P>For now, we'll get images displaying and that will suffice for a first version of layout for my technical writing endeavors.</P>
      <P>Medium gives you 4 image layout options:</P>
      <Ol>
        <Li>Outset Left (text fills into a right column when the viewport width {'>'} 976px)</Li>
        <Li>Inset Center (image is same width as text, has left/right spacing in mobile view)</Li>
        <Li>Outset Center (image is wider than text, no left/right spacing in tablet view and smaller)</Li>
        <Li>Fill Width (image goes 100% width of the viewport all the time)</Li>
      </Ol>
      <P>If I had to pick just one of those layout options because <StrikeText>I'm lazy</StrikeText> I'm highly motivated to ship - it would be Outset Center.  Ok, let's do it</P>
      <P>The markup looks like this (starting from a 'section' or row of content):</P>
    </ContentSection>
    <CodeSection>
      <Pre>{'<div className="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn">'}</Pre>
      <Pre>  {'<figure'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'tabIndex="0"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'name="a433"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'className="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p is-selected"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'contentEditable="false"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>  {'>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'<div className="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 675px;">'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'<div className="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.5%;"></div>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'<img'}</Pre>
      <Pre>        {'className="graf-image"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>        {'data-image-id="1*p_Id9vQKTbE-V31yXS5MIg.jpeg"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>        {'data-width="2404"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>        {'data-height="1622"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>        {'src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*p_Id9vQKTbE-V31yXS5MIg.jpeg"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>        {'data-delayed-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*p_Id9vQKTbE-V31yXS5MIg.jpeg"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'/>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'<div className="crosshair u-ignoreBlock"></div>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'</div>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'<figcaption'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'className="imageCaption"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'data-default-value="Type caption for image (optional)"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>      {'contentEditable="true"'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'>The high desert somewhere between Zacatecas &amp; Monterrey, Mexico'}</Pre>
      <Pre>    {'</figcaption>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>  {'</figure>'}</Pre>
      <Pre>{'</div>'}</Pre>
    </CodeSection>
    <ContentSection>
      <P>First thing I noticed is the use of the <Code>{'<figure>'}</Code> and <Code>{'<figcaption>'}</Code> tags. üëè for using semantic tags, it's not everyday you get to you use them you know?  The second thing I notice, and especially when using <A href="https://css-tricks.com/throttling-the-network/">throttling in the network tab</A>, is the use of a grey placeholder the same size as the image.  Using placeholders definitely provides a better UX - the page won't jump around as the assets load.</P>
      <P>Medium does image resizing, fingerprinting and probably initial (small) + deferred (full-size) image swaps.  My image is pretty small at <Code>140k</Code> but, I'd imagine above a certain threshold they'll load a preview image.  I'm going to punt on that for now.</P>
      <P>It's interesting to see how they use the CDN path to route to assets by size <Code>/max/1000</Code>üßê  Go directly to their CDN base route for a fun time <A href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/</A></P>
      <P>The image has it's original dimensions as <Code>data-</Code> attributes on the <Code>{'<img>'}</Code> tag.  These can be used to scale the <Code>aspectRatioPlaceholder</Code> container before the asset loads.  The 'Outset Center' layout option comes with a <Code>max-width: 1000px;</Code> constraint.  Use that to find a scale factor <Code>2404 / 1000 = 2.404</Code> and then find our new height <Code>Math.ceil(1622 / 2.404) = 675</Code></P>

    <H2>Where should I put these images?</H2>
    <ContentSection>
      <P><Code>S3</Code> right?  Sure, I could do that</P>

      <P><SiteInfo>Today we got an image to display. This is big, people.  Almost as big as the quote below.  Next, I think it's time to start thinking about how to CRUD these blog posts: modelling the data, rendering the model, storing the data, serving the data, routing to posts, an admin view, aaaaand looks like there's plenty to write about for a while... ü§î</SiteInfo></P>
      <P>üí°Remember: <ItalicText>This project is experimental and of course comes without any warranty whatsoever.
